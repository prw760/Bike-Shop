<p></p><h5 id="theory">Theory</h5><p>When defining your models in Django, you may want users to select one of the available options. For this, you can use the <code class="language-python">CharField</code> option.</p><p>Suppose you must define the <code class="language-python">Cat</code> model with the predefined options for cat breeds. The code could look as follows:</p><pre><code class="language-python">class Cat(models.Model):

    EUROPEAN = 'EU'
    PERSIAN = 'PE'
    BRITISH = 'BR'
    CAT_BREEDS = [
        (EUROPEAN, 'European'),
        (PERSIAN, 'Persian'),
        (BRITISH, 'British'),
    ]
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    breed = models.CharField(max_length=2, choices=CAT_BREEDS, default=EUROPEAN)
    age = models.IntegerField()
    height = models.FloatField()
    weight = models.FloatField()
    </code></pre><p>You can refer to the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field.choices" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">official documentation</a> for more information on field choices.</p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>You run a small bike shop with a few very fancy bike models. You think your shop could benefit from a simple website where your customers could check out the available bikes and order the one that catches their eye. Besides, your employees will appreciate a tool that could help them keep track of the orders and bike parts with the admin panel. </p><p>Your employees also make custom bikes from various bike parts; some parts can be used for several models, for example, certain tire types, different seats, and frames. Let's start with the website, step by step!</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>Let's start with the database by defining data models. Your first task is to create the models and define their relationships.</p><p>To build a bike, you need a frame, seat, and tires; some bikes have a basket. Further, you need a separate database table where you can store information on the orders of your beloved customers. Your task is to define the following models:</p><ul><li><p><code class="language-python">Frame</code> — This model should have two fields: <code class="language-python">color</code> (<code class="language-python">CharField</code>) and <code class="language-python">quantity</code> (<code class="language-python">IntegerField</code>);</p></li><li><p><code class="language-python">Seat</code> — the same fields as above;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-python">Tire</code> — this model should have two fields: <code class="language-python">type</code> (<code class="language-python">CharField</code>) and <code class="language-python">quantity</code> (<code class="language-python">IntegerField</code>);</p></li><li><p><code class="language-python">Basket</code> — only one field: <code class="language-python">quantity</code> (<code class="language-python">IntegerField</code>) as you're going to use only one type of basket for all bikes;</p></li><li><p><code class="language-python">Bike</code> — this model is linked with the ones above. After all, a bike consists of all these elements; you need three fields that serve as foreign keys to the relevant models: <code class="language-python">frame</code>, <code class="language-python">tire</code>, and <code class="language-python">seat</code>. Make sure you also have the <code class="language-python">name</code> (<code class="language-python">CharField</code>), <code class="language-python">description</code> (<code class="language-python">TextField</code>), and <code class="language-python">has_basket</code> (<code class="language-python">BooleanField</code>);</p></li><li><p><code class="language-python">Order</code> — this model requires fields such as <code class="language-python">bike</code> (<code class="language-python">ForeignKey</code>), <code class="language-python">name</code>, <code class="language-python">surname</code>, and <code class="language-python">phone_number</code> — all <code class="language-python">CharFields</code>. Another field is <code class="language-python">status</code>. It should be <code class="language-python">CharField</code> and accept only one letter: either <code class="language-python">P</code> for "pending" or <code class="language-python">R</code> for "ready." </p></li></ul><p>Don't forget to migrate the models to the database!</p>

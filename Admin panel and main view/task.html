<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>We have the database up and running; it's time to fill it with data on your shop's bikes! The staff needs the admin panel where they can add all the relevant information on available bikes and parts. </p><p>It would be best if you also started working on the actual website. Perhaps, having the main page with all the available bikes would make a good start?</p><p>Let's start with the admin panel! First, you need to register all the models in the <em>admin.py</em> file. Once you've done it, it's time to create a superuser — use the username, email address, and password of your choice. Next, log in to the admin panel (it should be available at <em>localhost:8000/admin/) </em>and add some data. Remember to start with frames, seats, tires, and available baskets. After this, build some bikes out of the available components. Adding 2-3 cycles of different frame colors, seats, and tire types is a good idea. Add some variations with baskets; it will make the testing easier in the later stages. Please don't add any orders for now; they are for later stages.</p><p> </p><p>If you want to make your admin panel more user-friendly and display the name of your bike instead of <code class="java">Bike object (1)</code>,<em> </em>use the<em> </em><code class="java">__str__()</code> method. You can read more on the method in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/models/instances/#str" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">official documentation</a>.</p><p> </p><p>It would also be great to see the bikes listed nicely on the website, wouldn't it? Let's draw up such a page. Create a dedicated view, the <em>urls.py</em> file, with relevant content and add a template. The page should be available at <em>localhost:8000/bikes/. </em>There is only one requirement on how the page should look — all the bikes from the database should be displayed as separate elements of the unordered list; all the rest is up to you. Check the screenshot below as a reference.</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><ul><li><p>Add the admin panel and create the superuser;</p></li><li><p>Add some bike parts and build some custom bikes;</p></li><li><p>Create the <em>url.py </em>file with a dedicated view and list the bikes as separate elements of the unordered list.</p></li></ul><h5 id="example">Example</h5><p><strong>Example 1: </strong><em>An</em><strong> </strong><em>example of the /bikes/ page.</em></p><p><picture><source media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="https://ucarecdn.com/e8472a45-5f7a-4f19-936f-ac870fa27774/-/stretch/off/-/resize/480x/-/format/webp/ 1x,https://ucarecdn.com/e8472a45-5f7a-4f19-936f-ac870fa27774/-/stretch/off/-/resize/960x/-/format/webp/ 2x,https://ucarecdn.com/e8472a45-5f7a-4f19-936f-ac870fa27774/-/stretch/off/-/resize/1440x/-/format/webp/ 3x" type="image/webp"/><source media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="https://ucarecdn.com/e8472a45-5f7a-4f19-936f-ac870fa27774/-/stretch/off/-/resize/800x/-/format/webp/ 1x,https://ucarecdn.com/e8472a45-5f7a-4f19-936f-ac870fa27774/-/stretch/off/-/resize/1600x/-/format/webp/ 2x,https://ucarecdn.com/e8472a45-5f7a-4f19-936f-ac870fa27774/-/stretch/off/-/resize/2400x/-/format/webp/ 3x" type="image/webp"/><source srcset="https://ucarecdn.com/e8472a45-5f7a-4f19-936f-ac870fa27774/-/stretch/off/-/resize/1100x/-/format/webp/ 1x,https://ucarecdn.com/e8472a45-5f7a-4f19-936f-ac870fa27774/-/stretch/off/-/resize/2200x/-/format/webp/ 2x,https://ucarecdn.com/e8472a45-5f7a-4f19-936f-ac870fa27774/-/stretch/off/-/resize/3000x/-/format/webp/ 3x" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Bike Shop site: the /bikes/ page" height="254" src="https://ucarecdn.com/e8472a45-5f7a-4f19-936f-ac870fa27774/" width="441"/></picture></p>
